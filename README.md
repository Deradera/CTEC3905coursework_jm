# CTEC3905 Coursework - Assignment 2
---
*This reposotiry contains the code for my practical coursework for CTEC3905.*

The basis for this project was to make an information site about my Dad's recently started business in Quality Assurance for Aerospace Engineering and Medical Supply Manufacturing. The logo used as the site icon and in the top left of the webpage was provided by my dad for use on the proper website which will have the content filled out properly. Any other images were found from various wallpaper/stock image websites.

Due to time constraints on both my end and my Dad's end, we were unable to solidify what the content of the webpage should be. As such I have used Lorem ipsum paragraphs to fill out the page in where we imagined the actual text would be. There are some places I have placed more relevant text as well.

I sectioned out what the most logical sections would be for displaying information:
- Home
- Consultancy - This would be a rundown of the services offered
- Certification - This would display the certification that my Dad has (What ISO standards he can audit)
- Contact - This contains a form where a message can be sent to the company email address, though for the purpse of this development project the emails will be directed to my university email address.

The shadow under the header bar is code adapted from [here](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-box-shadow/)
